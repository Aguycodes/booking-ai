Approach to the Project
1️.FastAPI & RAG System
Data Processing: Loaded and cleaned hotel booking data from CSV.
Analytics Implementation: Calculated revenue trends, cancellations, booking lead time, and geographical distribution.
RAG-Based Q&A:
1. Converted booking data into text format.
2. Generated vector embeddings using sentence-transformers.
3. Stored embeddings in FAISS for fast similarity search.
4. Integrated an LLM for response generation.



2️. Additional Features

Real-Time Database Updates:
1. Used SQLite for bookings.
2. Auto-updated FAISS embeddings when new bookings were added.
3. Query History Tracking: Stored user queries & responses in a database.
4. Health Check API: Monitored database, FAISS, and LLM status.

Challenges Encountered & Solutions

1️.Handling Large Datasets in FAISS
Storing large booking data in FAISS caused memory issues.
2️.Slow API Response in RAG System
LLM-generated answers were slow, especially with large retrievals.
3️. Real-Time Data Updates
FAISS does not support automatic updates; it required rebuilding the index.
